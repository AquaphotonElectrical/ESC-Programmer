# Bring Your Design Into Life by JLCPCB
With our PCB design finalized, the next step is to seamlessly order the printed circuit boards (PCBs). Simply head over to JLCPCB, our project sponsor and China's leading PCB prototype enterprise. Click on the "QUOTE NOW" button to initiate the ordering process.

JLCPCB offers a fantastic deal with a minimum order of just 5 PCBs for $2. Upload the Gerber file obtained in the previous stepâ€”simply drag and drop the.zip file. Upon successful upload, a confirmation message will appear. Use the Gerber viewer to inspect both the top and bottom views of the PCB to ensure everything aligns perfectly.

Once satisfied with the design, proceed to place the order at an affordable rate. While 5 PCBs are available for $2, first-time orders qualify for an even more attractive offer: 10 PCBs for the same price. Click on "SAVE TO CART" to finalize the order.
